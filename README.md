- [This website](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/configure-your-dvcs-username-for-commits/) was useful for git LFS stuff.
- Git LFS is a bit confusing and apparently I merged a branch which does not even exist(?), I hope this isn't a big deal.
- Note to myself; 
* git commit -m "put your commit message here"
* don't forget to set user.name and user.email
